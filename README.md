# BMI_Project
This is a body mass index project. We have patient body mass index data from 2 years to 20 years. However, not only 16/17 fraction of data is missing,but also the the time interval for bmi data points for a given individual are varied. The task is to predict the long term trajectory of body mass index given a input body index(input can also have few data range from 2 to 20 years). Data is first being imputed, for each individual, best machting bmi trajectory from another individual will be find and two data will be merged. After all the data is being imputed, we fit a a 1 degree interploation and get time equally divived bmi data points for each individual. Afterwards, a tensor lstm model are used to train the imputed data.
